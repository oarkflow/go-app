Core Features
Actor Definition

Define actors as isolated entities with private state and message-handling logic.

Support functional or struct-based behaviors with type-safe message processing (using Go generics).

Message Passing

Asynchronous, non-blocking communication using channels (mailboxes).

Immutable message structures to prevent unintended side effects.

Support for fire-and-forget and request-response patterns (via reply channels).

Mailbox System

Buffered/unbuffered channels with configurable capacity.

Sequential message processing to ensure state safety.

Priority queues (optional for advanced use cases).

Actor Addressing (ActorRef/PID)

Unique references (e.g., PID or ActorRef) to send messages.

Registry service for looking up actors by name/ID.

Concurrency Model

Each actor runs in a dedicated goroutine.

Efficient goroutine pooling for large-scale systems.

Supervision Hierarchy

Parent-child relationships for fault isolation.

Supervision strategies: restart, stop, escalate (one-for-one, all-for-one).

Fault Tolerance

Recovery from panics via supervision.

Health checks and monitoring (e.g., watch for actor lifecycle events).

Lifecycle Management

Hooks for preStart, postStop, and preRestart.

Graceful shutdown of the entire actor system.

State Management

Encapsulated state modified only through message processing.

Support for stateful behaviors (e.g., state machines).

Advanced Features
Remote Actors & Clustering

Location transparency for cross-node communication (e.g., gRPC, TCP).

Cluster management for distributed actor systems.

Routing Strategies

Routers for load balancing (round-robin, consistent hashing).

Scatter-gather and broadcast patterns.

Persistence & Event Sourcing

Snapshotting and restoring actor state.

Append-only event logs for state reconstruction.

Timers & Scheduling

Send delayed or periodic messages (e.g., context.WithTimeout).

Pub/Sub Mechanisms

Topic-based messaging for event-driven architectures.

Dynamic Behavior Switching

Modify message-handling logic at runtime (e.g., Become()).

Supporting Features
Registry & Discovery

Centralized or decentralized actor lookup service.

Logging & Metrics

Integration with logging libraries (e.g., Zap, Logrus).

Prometheus metrics for message throughput, latency, and errors.

Testing Utilities

Mock mailboxes, in-memory systems, and message assertions.

Configuration

YAML/TOML support for mailbox sizes, timeouts, and retries.

Middleware/Interceptors

Intercept messages for logging, validation, or rate limiting.

Context Propagation

Pass context.Context for cancellation and deadlines.

Go-Specific Optimizations
Type Safety

Use generics (Go 1.18+) for compile-time message validation.

Goroutine Management

Prevent leaks via structured concurrency (tied to actor lifecycle).

Efficient Serialization

JSON, Protobuf, or MessagePack for remote messaging.

Integration with Go Ecosystem

Compatibility with context, sync, and net/http.
